This is one cool function I have been looking forward to make

It basically takes a function, a development point and a degree and computes the taylor polynomial with said degree at said point.
For the execution I used the conda CLI. Also, you would need tkinter, sympy and matplotlib libraries as well. Have fun! (I certainly did :) )
